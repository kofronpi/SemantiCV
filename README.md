SemantiCV
=========

A Python 3 application that allows you to create a basic resum√© and export it to various semantic formats such as Turtle, N3, NT, TRIG.

Uses the RDFLIB library (https://rdflib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)


###How-to use

Clone the repository:
  
    git clone https://github.com/kofronpi/SemantiCV.git
  
Install RDFlib and just start:

    pip3 install rdflib
    Python3 cli.py


###Roadmap

The 0.2 release version will implement user input control.

In a future release, the user will be able to load and save his CV to work on it later, and more CV categories will be added to the ontology (Interests, Publications).

An import from a LaTeX CV is also thought about.
